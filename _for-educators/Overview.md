**There are plenty of wonderful resources on the great wide Web.**

But they aren’t always pitched appropriately, or tailored to the Singaporean context, or they come from different websites so it’s hard to have continuity and coherence…

Yummy Buddies aim to address these pain points by creating quality resources curated by and created in partnership with experts in their fields and aligned with MOE curriculum and localised to the Singaporean context.
