Bouncy is our cheerful hero. This exuberant fishball is easily excited by all things new and novel. Bouncy has a quick wit and an infectious sense of humour, but his tendency towards cheekiness sometimes lands him in hot water. Fortunately, with the help of his friends, he always manages to bounce himself out a tight spot.

Bouncy likes to explore new things, rolling and bouncing into situations head-first with his group of trusty friends, the Yummy Buddies!
