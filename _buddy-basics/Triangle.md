Merry is a watermelon slice with a huge competitive streak. Sports and games come naturally to her, and she instinctively sizes up every situation to find a way to come out on top. This gung-ho gal likes thing fast and furious, and sometimes thumbs her nose at those with a more measured approach to life.
