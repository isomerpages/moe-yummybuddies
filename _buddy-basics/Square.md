He may be a prata, but life with Flip is anything but flat. Flip wears his heart on his sleeve, and sometimes finds it hard to control his emotions. He views the world in simple terms. Things are either black or white, good or bad, right or wrong. Flip chases perfection, and believes that hard work is the solution to all problems.
