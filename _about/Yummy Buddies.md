![bouncy](/images/Characters/char_bouncy.jpg)
**Bouncy** is our cheerful hero. This exuberant fishball is easily excited by all things new and novel. Bouncy has a quick wit and an infectious sense of humour, but his tendency towards cheekiness sometimes lands him in hot water. Fortunately, with the help of his friends, he always manages to bounce himself out a tight spot.

![merry](/images/Characters/char_merry.jpg)
**Merry** is a watermelon slice with a huge competitive streak. Sports and games come naturally to her, and she instinctively sizes up every situation to find a way to come out on top. This gung-ho gal likes thing fast and furious, and sometimes thumbs her nose at those with a more considered approach to life.

![flip](/images/Characters/char_flip.jpg)
He may be a prata, life with **Flip** is anything but flat. Flip wears his heart on his sleeve, and sometimes finds it hard to control his emotions. He views the world in simple terms. Things are either black or white, good or bad, right or wrong. Flip chases perfection, and believes that hard work is the solution to all problems.

![pok pok](/images/Characters/char_pok_pok.jpg)
**Pok Pok** is an artistic curry puff who views the world with a childlike sense of wonder. Her friends sometimes find her flighty and naive, but this gentle curry puff is simply an eternal optimist who believes the best about people and tries her best to see things from many points of view.
