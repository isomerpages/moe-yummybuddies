description: Overview of Yummy Buddies
---
The Yummy Buddies are a ragtag group of friends made up largely of personified Singaporean food. 

Just like young children, the Yummy Buddies are immensely curious about the world around them, and are always game for adventure. Each character has a distinct personality and unique quirks that reflect their type of food. These often land them in unusual and often humorous situations as they explore the world around them.
 
Life is never boring with the Yummy Buddies!
