![bouncy](/images/Characters/char_bouncy.jpg)
**Bouncy** is our cheerful hero. This exuberant fishball is easily excited by all things new and novel. Bouncy has a quick wit and an infectious sense of humour, but his tendency towards cheekiness sometimes lands him in hot water. Fortunately, with the help of his friends, he always manages to bounce himself out a tight spot.

![merry](/images/Characters/char_merry.jpg)
**Merry** is a watermelon slice with a huge competitive streak. Sports and games come naturally to her, and she instinctively sizes up every situation to find a way to come out on top. This gung-ho gal likes thing fast and furious, and sometimes thumbs her nose at those with a more measured approach to life.

![flip](/images/Characters/char_flip.jpg)
He may be a prata, but life with **Flip** is anything but flat. Flip wears his heart on his sleeve, and sometimes finds it hard to control his emotions. He views the world in simple terms. Things are either black or white, good or bad, right or wrong. Flip chases perfection, and believes that hard work is the solution to all problems.

![pok pok](/images/Characters/char_pok_pok.jpg)
**Pok Pok** is an artistic curry puff who views the world with a childlike sense of wonder. Her friends sometimes find her flighty and naive, but this gentle curry puff is simply an eternal optimist who believes the best about people and tries her best to see things from many points of view.

![wata](/images/Characters/char_wata.jpg)
**Wata** the water bottle is considerate and caring, often to a fault – his friends sometimes find his help excessive and mildly annoying. On the rare occasion he loses his cool, Wata literally gets boiling mad - the water in him heats up, and steam spurts out from his spout, giving new meaning to the phrase ‘blowing his top’.

![coco](/images/Characters/char_coco.jpg)
This brainy chocolate-coated stick biscuit  absorbs information like a sponge and is always hungry for knowledge. The other Yummy Buddies instinctively turn to him when they have questions and **Coco** delights in helping them solve their little crises with little nuggets of obscure information.

![ms g](/images/Characters/char_msg.jpg)
**Ms. G** is the Yummy Buddies’ favourite teacher. This green apple with a nurturing nature knows that all young learners have a burning curiosity about the world, and together with Poodle, her faithful AI dogbot, Ms. G does her best to help them on the path to discovery.

![poodle](/images/Characters/char_poodle.jpg)
**Poodle** combines a puppy’s enthusiasm with the power of the Internet at its finger-, or rather, paw-tips. This AI dogbot, however, doesn’t always have all the right answers (especially if he hasn’t updated to the latest version!). Luckily, Ms. G knows to fact-check and use good ol’ common sense to verify anything Poodle gives her.
