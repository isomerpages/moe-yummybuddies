<h4>Creator's notes</h4><p><strong>Different day, different face</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Your ideas/crow_linework.png"></div><p><strong>Creators’ notes:</strong><br>This strip was inspired by the spate of crow attacks in February 2023. We did some research and learned that crows are able to recognise human faces. Since Pok Pok enjoys arts and crafts, we made her the main character, and her creative solution to the crow problem made for a strong punchline!</p><p><strong>What the wi-fi</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Your ideas/wifi_linework.png"></div><p><strong>Creators’ notes:</strong><br>This strip shows off the Yummy Buddies’ characters well. We see Ms. G planning interesting lessons for her students, and also how Poodle needs a strong wi-fi signal to be an effective assistant to her. In the last two panels, we see how Bouncy and Merry’s playfulness is the unexpected cause of Poodle’s problems. There’s also an important safety message at the end, delivered by the peace-loving Wata.</p><p><strong>Keeping up with technology</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Your ideas/tech_linework.png"></div><p><strong>Creators’ notes:</strong><br>One day, while watching her dog run away from her robot vacuum cleaner, our writer suddenly wondered, What if the dog could understand how harmless (and helpful!) the vacuum cleaner actually was? This became the inspiration for this strip. Coco, who constantly seeks new knowledge, was the perfect character to teach his friends about being open to new ideas.</p><p><br></p>
