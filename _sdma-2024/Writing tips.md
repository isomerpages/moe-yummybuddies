<h4><strong>Tips for the budding comic storywriter</strong></h4><p>Here are some helpful tips from the creators of the Yummy Buddies stories to get you started!</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Your ideas/tip1.png"></div><p><strong>Tip #1: Think about everyday life</strong></p><p>Find inspiration in your own experiences and the world around you. What problems have you faced or read about that turned into funny or interesting moments, and what lesson did you learn from them? Chances are, someone else will relate to your story and learn something from it too!</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Your ideas/tip2.png"></div><p><strong>Tip #2: Make it funny</strong></p><p>What’s a comic strip without humour? Here are some simple ways to make your reader chuckle:</p><ul><li><p><em>Ask ‘What if?’ questions: </em>This is a useful technique to trigger your imagination and introduce elements that may not exist in the real world. For example, <em>What if penguins went on vacation? What if mushrooms made music? What if a computer virus were a supervillain who wore a cape? </em>‘What if?’ questions can help you see things from different perspectives and often lead to unique and unexpected storylines.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><em>Use visual humour</em>: Exaggerated facial expressions and body language work really well in comics. Showing your characters in motion, or engaged in an activity, also makes your scenes more dynamic, not to mention more fun to draw!</p></li><li><p><em>Use wordplay and puns: </em>Playful language can add an extra layer of humor to the dialogue or captions.</p></li><li><p><em>Finish strong</em>: The last few panels should reveal your comic strip’s underlying message and its punchline. This could be in the form of a witty comment, an unexpected reaction, or a clever resolution. A strong finish will make your comic strip more memorable to your reader!</p></li></ul><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Your ideas/tip3.png"></div><p><strong>Tip #3: Add that special Yummy Buddies’ flavour</strong></p><p>Every Yummy Buddy has its unique physical traits and personality. Bouncy is springy and curious, while Flip is flat and impulsive. Merry’s full of sweet juice, while Wata is made of metal. Can you find ways for them and the other Yummy Buddies to show off their special traits?</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Your ideas/characters_intro.png"></div><p>Click <a href="/your-ideas/resources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to learn how the Yummy Buddies’ creators developed ideas for some of the comic strips!</p>
